In this section we provide practical reasons and examples of baseline queries practitioners adopt for `learning the environment` they are defending.

We are aiming to relate our query examples with public domain resources like `SANS`, or research from individual security professionals in the community.

## Using this repo
In the code blocks, we are providing the query syntax, you can copy/paste into your Real Time Search - RTS.

Throughout the content, we build from basic to more elaborate queries.

This repo is broken down by category of collectors in each section, and the table below represents how to find/associate queries to use-cases.
